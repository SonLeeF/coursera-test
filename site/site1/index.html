<h1>Hello Coursera! It's a great day! </h1>
<h2>	 Once upon a time, there was a great kingdom called Majerhell. In this dark and dismal land there was a council, the Smedom, that tried to help keep track of the threats that crept into Majerhell. </h2>

<h3> There was Mati-Tyah : overseer of the council. </h3>
<h3> There was  Damsel: newest of the council. </h3>
<p> Damsel was not known to be of much assistance to the council. Mostly wandered around in vague to extreme confusion. </p>
<p> Some would wonder as to Damsel's appointment to the council, but it was in no large part due to the fact that past council members tended to disappear at an alarming rate. </p> 
<h3> There was Murder-Mittens : who kept them all in line. </h3>
<h3> There was Hedgehog : who was rather prickly really. </h3>
<p> Hedgehog was under the impression that the majority of the Smedom's work involved hovering around the cesspit of the commons and resolving issues that bubbled up to the surface. Hedgehog tended to be rather dreary.</p>
